# Whiskey2D
=========

Whiskey2D is an open-source 2D game editor. It was written on MonoGame and winForms for a Major Qualifying Project at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Whiskey2D was written by Chris Hanna and Daniel True. 

### About
-------

Whiskey2D uses GameObjects, Scripts, and Levels to create games. A GameObject holds data about an object, and Scripts control it. See this video for a basic tutorial on how to use the program http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVJHYpwkpFI
